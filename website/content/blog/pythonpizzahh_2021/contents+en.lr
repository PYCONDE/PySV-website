#### Why Python is our favorite Pizza topping!

This month we held the third Hamburg Python Pizza event! Originally planned as a hybrid event, where we hoped to spark connections between both those at remote and in person attending, we had to go full remote due to the rising covid numbers in Hamburg. While this was a setback, it didn't stop us hosting a great community event.


##### A community conference

[Python Pizza](https://python.pizza/) is a community run micro conference, which was started in Naples in 2017 by Python Italia. Bringing together people's love of both Python and Pizza it has since been held in Berlin, Hamburg and Holguin, Cuba ([where it will happen again in January 2021](https://holguin.python.pizza/?ref=python.pizza)) as well as a special Remote edition on New year's eve 2020.
The hallmark of this micro-conference is to present short, dynamic sessions, in which developers present their knowledge of the language or their own experiences with real-life projects. Each talk lasts 10 minutes (no more, no less).


> *"A good mix of topics, beyond the technical side of things. The plannable breaks turned out to be positive as well."*  -*Attendee*


For this edition we had 26 talks in total, 23% of which were from first time speakers, with a diverse lineup with speakers from all over the world. 
Two amazing keynotes kicked off both the morning and afternoon sessions, [Iqbal Abdullah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iqbalabd/) ([Tokio LaLoka Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/laloka-labs/)) on Saying Thank You and [Peggy Sylopp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peggy-sylopp/) (Berlin) on AI and Sustainability. 
Talks were streamed live on both Youtube and Twitter.

In between talks Tereza and Jessica from PyLadies Hamburg and Berlin had a go at the long running joke format, weaving stories about Einstein and his personal driver into the talk topics and then training their own AI on what it meant to be human based on the conference talks (Spoiler it was to throw Pizza parties).


> *"A conference can feel like meeting friends (even though I didn't know most of the people)"*  -*Attendee*


We also organized interactive networking sessions where speakers and participants could join video calls and were given optional conversation prompts. Participants joined our Discord channel where they could ask questions and connect to other participants throughout the day and [PyLadies Munich](https://twitter.com/pyladiesmunich) together with [Luciano Ramalho](https://twitter.com/ramalhoorg) ran a raffle for copies of Luciano's book [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/).

##### Organizing a micro conference

The event was organized mostly by women from the PyLadies community. With initially planning to be hybrid we had inclusiveness in mind and wanted the remote and in person experience to be equally engaging. As it became apparent our plans would have to change, we adapted, this was not without its challenges.


For those less familiar with what goes into organizing an event such as this, it includes: website updates as speakers were announced, social media art, regular social media posts, managing discord on the day, managing streamyard (our streaming platform), managing dry runs of event on streamyard, email communication with speakers, keynote selection, advertisement in their networks, late night syncs, reaching out to sponsors, hosting on the day and contributing with ideas and feedback.


> *"I couldn't have asked for a better experience/atmosphere for this. The writer's room was also a big help and I was thankful for the insights you provided regarding the CFP process."*
> -*[Arati](https://twitter.com/aratiarr), who made her speaking debut at Pyton Pizza*


Our approach to the CFP was that we accepted **ALL** the talks submitted, considering the range and quality of talks this was, we felt, quite outstanding. Before the conference
[PyLadies Berlin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/15830651/) ran a talk writers room event to support and encourage more people from under-represented groups to apply for conference talks.


> *"Getting in touch before, for the tech check up was super important to have everything smooth on stage. You did a great job behind the scenes!"*  -*Speaker*


##### What we learnt

While the overall feedback was positive, we also as an orga team made some important learnings. Rather than the multi platform approach we had which also expanded due to going full remote may have been better as a single platform for participants so they could stay in one place. 


Another unintentional learning was to have more breaks to split up blocks of talks: during the day we had missed an hour in our schedule which gave everyone a welcomed extra break. In our post conference survey participants were also keen to have a space dedicated to being able to ask speaker questions.


> *"I think it was great for online conference, but I prefer live events (hope they will be possible someday again)"* -*Attendee*


These learnings plus some more will help us make future editions, be there in person, remote or hybrid, better, and we are thankful to those who took the time to offer feedback.


We would like to thank all the attendees, speakers and the orga team for making an event that seemed to run so smoothly possible:
